PARIS TOURIST GUIDE Paris, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, the most visited, and probably the most romantic of those that populate the planet, lives up to its reputation and does not disappoint anyone who comes to visit it. This magical city has a special charm that can be perceived in every corner, every square, or simply in each of its cafes. Unlike other large European cities, Paris does not have a defined "center" around which the city expands; rather, all of Paris is "center", and this is because Paris has not been absorbing the small cities that were on its outskirts, but these have maintained their administrative independence despite the fact that the limit between one of these small cities and the great city of Paris is just a pedestrian crossing. The fact that it has been "locked away" for a long time makes the whole of Paris look old and classic, and a walk through Paris is like a walk through a place where time does not seem to exist, where despite the hustle and bustle of one of the most important cities in the world, the visitor will have the feeling of being in a place that has not changed for decades or even centuries. The nickname "City of Light" is due to the fact that Paris was the first city to equip its streets and important buildings with electric lighting, which caused admiration throughout the world, although this name could also be due to the fact that France, and Paris in particular, has also been the light of the world and a city ahead of its time, as shown by the fact that the rights of man and the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity were forged here, principles that are still not present in many places in the world today. Activities and Attractions Montmartre Perched atop Montmartre Hill, crowning the city of Paris, is the resplendent white Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre, which seems to watch over and control everything. Although it is Notre - Dame, the church (Cathedral in this case), which rightly holds the unofficial title of the most important religious monument in Paris, it can be a surprise to the visitor to discover the beauty of the Sacred Heart, Sacre Coeur for the French, and all its surroundings, a beauty that makes many tourists who visit Paris look for their hotel in Montmartre. Montmartre is located in the 18th arrondissement, that is, the 18th district of Paris, in the northern part of the city, and is one of the most charming neighborhoods, if not the most charming, in the city. Its sloping streets, its stairs, and its unmistakable and cozy cafes make Montmartre an unmissable destination for tourists. Although the whole district is really beautiful, the cherry on top is found when we reach the top of the hill, which we can access by taking a walk through its beautiful gardens and stairs, or by using the Montmartre funicular, which will leave us at the foot of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. It is also possible to climb up the back of the hill, through its steep and curved streets, arriving at the Place du Tertre. The Place Du Tertre Located behind the Basilica of Montmartre, the Square is always a busy place, mainly by tourists, but also by Parisians, attracted by this magical Square and its lively terraces and great atmosphere. Both the Square and its adjacent streets are full of souvenir shops and traditional restaurants for all budgets, all focused on welcoming and offering visitors everything they need. Apart from the unique composition of the square, with restaurants and terraces everywhere, the massive presence of painters, urban artists who come there to paint the square, take portraits of anyone who wants to or sell their paintings in the street, stands out. Precisely this influx of artists makes Montmartre often called the “Painters’ Quarter”. The Basilica of the Sacred Heart is at the top of the hill, from where the view is truly spectacular. Its origins date back to 1870; in that year France, at war with Germany, was not at its best, as part of its territory was occupied by the enemy and also relations with the Vatican were not at their best. Then the country's misfortunes began to be attributed more to a punishment from God than to an erroneous foreign policy, which translated into the widespread idea that it was necessary to build a temple to redeem oneself before God and beg forgiveness for the faults committed. In 1872, Cardinal Guibert approved the construction of a church, choosing Montmartre as the most appropriate location for them. In 1873, the National Assembly approved the project, and with it the final green light was given for the construction of the church. In 1919, the church was consecrated as a Basilica, which made it a place of pilgrimage, a sanctuary that attracts thousands of pilgrims from all over France and the entire world every year. As a curiosity, it is worth noting that the construction was carried out with money obtained from collections throughout France, with the names of the donors, many of them modest, inscribed on the stone of the Basilica. Eiffel Tower With a design created by Gustave Eiffel, the construction of the Eiffel Tower lasted just over two years and 250 workers worked on it. Initially, the tower was the subject of controversy: the artists of the time considered it monstrous and, given its low profitability at the end of the exhibition, the possibility of demolishing it was raised on several occasions. At the beginning of the 20th century, with the arrival of the world wars, the authorities found its use as a radio broadcasting antenna and with it they captured messages that helped the allies in a decisive way. Today, and thanks to the rise of Paris as an international tourist destination, the Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument in the world with more than 7 million visitors a year. It is the symbol of Paris, its most international image and a source of pride for the city. Going up the Eiffel Tower Going up the Eiffel Tower is a must, something that everyone who visits Paris must do, because if you don't go up it's almost as if you had never been there. To go up there we have different options, all of them with an extra charge, of course. The more athletic can use the stairs (1,665 steps, no more and no less), and for the rest (the majority) there are elevators that can take us either to the first or second floor, an option that is not recommended for those who suffer from vertigo, especially if there is a bit of wind, since you can feel the movement of the tower. On both floors there are different souvenir shops, as well as two luxury restaurants. At night the Eiffel Tower in Paris is always lit up, and every half hour (or one hour depending on the time of year) it shines for 10 minutes in sparkling lights, which is a real spectacle that can be seen from anywhere in Paris and its surroundings. The Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Élysées The Arc is located in the Place de l'Étoile, the starting point of several important avenues in Paris, including the most famous in the city and perhaps also the most famous in the world, the Champs-Élysées. The avenue is always a busy and crowded place, and is the favourite place for Parisians to shop, go to the cinema or have a drink on one of its terraces, which are always full of tourists. Here you will find the famous Lido de Paris, a large number of cinemas and an endless number of shopping galleries, restaurants and hotels. On the Champs Elysees everything is geared towards visitors and leisure, and even a visit to one of its car dealerships is interesting, as all the ones you find are always packed with curious people admiring the different prototypes or vintage and designer cars on display there. The terraces are always full and it is difficult to find a seat, and if you do find one you have to be careful what you order and look at the menu first, as for example the price of a beer is around or more (depending on the brand) €6. The Arc de Triomphe has witnessed countless historical moments, among which we could highlight: the passing of Napoleon's mortal remains on December 15, 1840 and the military parades of the two world wars in 1919 and 1944. As for its origins, they take place in 1806, when the then emperor Napoleon Bonaparte decided to build an Arc de Triomphe as a tribute to his armies and in honour of his victories. The arch is 50 metres high and has a base measuring 45 by 22 metres. On the lower walls of the Arch, which can be seen by crossing the centre of the square through underground accesses, are engraved the names of many generals and battles in which French troops participated. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was also built there at the end of World War I in 1919, and it is not difficult to find veterans of World War II with their uniforms and flags going there, whether to pay homage and remember their fallen comrades or to receive general homage and recognition. Although its height is much lower than that of the Eiffel Tower, the views from the top of the Arc de Triomphe are just as impressive. The dynamism of Paris at the confluence of twelve of its main avenues is worthy of admiration. The views of the Champs Elysees and the District of La Défense are also not inferior to the climb. To enter, you must pay an entrance fee and climb the 286 steps that separate the terrace from the ground. Inside, you will also see a small museum and information about its construction. Louvre Museum The Louvre Museum (in French: Musée du Louvre) is the national museum of France dedicated to art before Impressionism, including fine arts, archaeology and decorative arts. It is one of the most important in the world, located in the former royal palace of the Louvre, and is currently promoting the opening of two sub-branches, in Lens (France) and in Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates). Its extensive collections are the result of a double historical effort. To the collecting developed by the French monarchy over several centuries, was added the effort of the men of the Enlightenment, the disentailment work of the French Revolution and the archaeological campaigns and purchases promoted throughout the 19th century. The opening of the Louvre in 1793 marked, in the history of museums, the transfer of the private collections of the ruling classes (monarchy, aristocracy and Church) to public galleries for the enjoyment of society as a whole. The Louvre thus constituted the precedent for all the great national museums in Europe and North America, and in fact was the model for many of them. It is the most visited art museum in the world and the most remembered for several of its masterpieces, such as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The building that has housed the museum since its foundation is the old Louvre castle, later converted into a royal palace. Its origins date back to the 12th century, and it was embellished with Renaissance and later extensions. King Charles V accumulated his art collections in this building. The later monarchs Francis I and Henry II planned reforms to make it a true Renaissance royal residence. It was Queen Catherine de Médicis who drew up the project that made the Louvre the grand palace it is today, work that was continued by Henry IV after the Wars of Religion. Many artists have been involved in its architectural and decorative improvements over several centuries, from Claude Perrault and the painters Simon Vouet and Charles Le Brun in the 17th century to Delacroix and Georges Braque, who painted some of its ceilings. The construction of the Palace of Versailles, accelerated under the reign of Louis XIV, meant that the Louvre was vacated by the royal family at the end of the 17th century, and so the French Academy and later the other academies were installed there in the 18th century. Annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture were held there. Following the French Revolution, which led to the abolition of the monarchy, the Louvre Palace was used (by decree of May 1791) for artistic and scientific purposes, and the following year the collections of the crown were concentrated there. Part of the Louvre was opened to the public for the first time as a museum on 8 November 1793. This was a logical solution, given that it was occupied by the academies and because, as early as 1778, a plan had been drawn up to use its Grand Gallery as an art gallery. The novelty of the measure was that royal property was nationalised, and that access was free, not limited to the educated public or regulated by pre-arranged visits, as was the case at the Uffizi and the Prado Museums during their early years. The enormous museum, whose rooms and corridors mark out a route of several kilometres, underwent an ambitious modernisation in the 1980s, the most visible element of which was the glass pyramid. It was designed by architect Ieoh Ming Pei and opened in 1989 to centralise access for visitors, who descend through it to an underground hall through which they access the various rooms of the museum. Tuileries Garden The Tuileries Garden bears this name because it was originally used for the manufacture of tiles (tuiles), but Catherine de Medicis ordered the construction of a palace. Later, Louis XIV remodelled it and opened it to the city's elite, making it the first public garden in Paris. Located between the Place de la Concorde and the Louvre Museum, this beautiful garden is, to this day, another of the many public spaces in the French capital that is very popular with Parisians. Here, it is common to sit and read, have a coffee or simply watch people go by and admire the different postcards that the garden offers. With its fountains, ponds and sculptures, this place is another of the must-sees in Paris. The Paris Opera The Paris Opera (known as the Opera Garnier) is one of the most beautiful and representative buildings in Paris, and its view from the central island of the Place de la Opera, always full of tourists, where the entrances to the metro are located, is impressive. The Opera is located as a central element in the Place de la Opera, to which it gives its name, and is very close to the Louvre Museum, which is just a 10-minute walk along the Avenue de la Opera, one of the few in Paris that does not have any trees planted at the express wish of Napoleon III, who feared being shot from the windows of the side buildings, hidden by branches and leaves. The Opera building was built by the architect Charles Garnier between 1861 and 1874 by order of Napoleon III, who ironically would not live to see the inauguration of the theatre ‐ ó opera in 1876, with the opera Jeanne D ´ Arc, by Mermet, although the initials N ‐ E (Napole ó n ‐ Eug è ne, his wife) preside over the main façade. More than just a place to enjoy the opera , the building was a place of prestige, an elitist circle where the bourgeoisie and aristocracy came to show off, and even today the Paris Opera continues to impress with its monumentality, its splendid entrance staircase and its sumptuous decoration overloaded with gold and chandeliers. Apart from the magnificent staircase, the stage is also worth highlighting, especially its surprising dome decorated with magnificent paintings by Chagall. The impressive gallery that overlooks the balconies facing the Place de la Opera is no less impressive than the rest, and today important parties, social events and receptions are held there. Today, the Palais de la Opera de Garnier mainly hosts ballet performances, and only on special occasions is classical opera performed there, as these performances are normally held in the new opera house, in Bastille, which is more practical but much less spectacular. To get an idea of its monumentality, suffice it to say that its surface area is 11,237 square metres. Notre Dame Cathedral The Notre - Dame Cathedral is without a doubt the best-known church in Paris , being the quintessential representative work of the Gothic style worldwide . Its privileged location , bordered by the Seine and with gardens in front and behind , mean that the cathedral can be observed in its entirety with total comfort for the visitor, who can immortalise their visit with beautiful photographs from any of the bridges that cross the river , from its front garden , with the two main towers presiding over the image, from one side, being able to highlight the expressiveness of its famous gargoyles, or from the back, where the tall spires that crown its “roof” stand out. The construction of Notre - Dame Cathedral took place between the 12th and 14th centuries (from 1163 to 1345 to be exact), and the project was designed by Maurice de Sully. The interior is certainly not as impressive as the exterior for the art novice, but it is certainly impressive to enter the cathedral and stand in the central aisle of the church facing the altar, observing all its grandeur and immensity. There is a museum with a treasure in its sacristy, which is accessed from inside the church. If we can choose a day and time to visit Notre - Dame, it may be interesting to do so on Saturday at 2:30 p.m., as at that time there is a completely free guided tour in Spanish . The cathedral has a Latin cross plan, a façade 40 metres wide, a length of 130 metres, and a maximum height of 69 metres. For those who love statistics, the cathedral contains 5 naves, 37 chapels, 3 rose windows with a diameter of 13.5 metres each and a total of 113 stained glass windows. Palace of Versailles Located on the outskirts of Paris, this monumental palace occupied by Louis XIV and built in the mid-17th century, has dazzling multicoloured gardens and period decoration that draws attention due to the care and maintenance of the different pieces. This place is magical and unique, a must-see for anyone visiting France for the first time. Declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO more than thirty years ago, the Palace of Versailles is one of the most famous palaces in the world, not only for its imposing architecture and its endless, well-kept gardens, but because it constitutes an important part of French history. Visiting the Palace During a visit to the Palace of Versailles, you can visit a multitude of rooms with a wealth of artistic treasures, including the enormous chapel and the King and Queen's Grand Apartments, which contain a large number of decorative elements. Also of particular importance is the Hall of Mirrors, an impressive 73-metre-long gallery with 375 mirrors. This is one of the most important rooms in the palace, as it was the place where the First World War was brought to an end in 1919 with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. Gardens of Versailles Louis XIV was the first to transform and extend the hunting lodge of his father, Louis XIII, where he would set up the Court and the government in 1682. From then until the arrival of the French Revolution, different monarchs succeeded one another on the throne and continued to embellish the palace. In 1661 work began on the creation of the Gardens of Versailles, which would not be completed until forty years later. The construction of the gardens was hard work, as the land was covered by forests and marshy ground, so the help of thousands of men was needed to transport soil and all kinds of trees. In 1789 the palace ceased to function as the official seat of power and later became the Museum of the History of France. The impressive Gardens of Versailles cover an area of more than 800 hectares, spread across which plants and all kinds of trees spread out, as well as a large number of marble statues, ponds and fountains. It is practically impossible to tour the entire gardens, but there are different ways to try, for example by renting a bicycle or an electric car, or by taking the little train that runs through them. Some of the most important parts of the garden are the Grand Trianon, a small pink marble palace, or Marie Antoinette's Estate, where Louis XVI's wife enjoyed a simple, country life. From April to October it is possible to attend shows in which the fountains move their waters to the rhythm of music. It is important to find out about the opening hours beforehand, as they only operate for a few hours each day. Paris Bridges The River Seine runs through Paris, dividing the city into several parts. Along the 13 kilometres of the river that run through the city there are more than 30 bridges and walkways of all kinds, from the oldest ones built in stone to the most sober and recent ones made of metal. Among the most interesting bridges in the city there are some that are worth highlighting: Pont Alexandre III The Pont Alexandre III is the most beautiful of the Parisian bridges. The bridge, inaugurated for the World Exhibition of 1900, is located between the Esplanade des Invalides and the Grand and Petit Palais. The bridge is made up of a single steel arch, which was quite a challenge for that time. Its decoration is simply spectacular thanks to the four 17-metre columns, with golden winged horses on the top, which are located at the ends. Beautiful black chandeliers, cherubs and other decorative elements make the bridge a dreamlike construction that couples often choose to take their wedding photos. Pont de l'Alma The Pont de l'Alma is not one of the most beautiful in the city, nor the longest or the oldest, but since its construction the eyes of Parisians have been drawn to it to check the flooding of the river. Measurements were made using the statue of a Zouave (infantry soldier) that is carved into one of the pillars of the bridge. During the Flood of 1910 the Seine reached the shoulders of the Zouave. Today, tourists also come to the bridge to visit the tunnel in which Princess Diana lost her life. At the top of the tunnel you can see the Flame of Liberty, a monument with which America thanked France for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty, but which many use to place their offerings to the deceased princess. Decorated with beautiful black chandeliers and over 300 carved masks, the Pont Neuf (New Bridge), located at the western end of the Île de la Cité, is one of the most beautiful bridges in the city. Paradoxically, it is the oldest bridge in Paris. It is also the longest bridge in the city at 232 metres in length. Built between 1587 and 1607, it was the first stone bridge to be built in Paris, as the previous ones were made of wood. The bridge was a novelty for its time, as it became the first to cross the Seine in its entire width, connecting the two banks of the river and the westernmost part of the Île de la Cité. In addition to this, the first pedestrian sidewalks were installed and small viewing platforms on each of the columns. The Pont des Arts or Passerelle des Arts (French: Pont des Arts or Passerelle des Arts) is a pedestrian bridge over the Seine in Paris, located in the 6th Arrondissement. It connects the Institute of France with the Louvre Museum. Built from 1801 to 1804, it was the first metal bridge in Paris. It is occasionally used for art exhibitions, and is also a place that attracts tourists, painters, illustrators and photographers for the panoramic views it offers of the Île de la Cité and the bridges of Paris. It is remembered as the meeting point between "La Maga" and "Oliveira" in Julio Cortázar's novel Hopscotch. In recent years, the bridge has been used as the setting for a custom of couples visiting Paris. The gesture consists of closing a padlock on the bridge, which has the names of the couple or some other message written on it. The key to the padlock is then thrown into the River Seine, symbolizing that the love between the two will be eternal. There are two theories about the origin of the custom: ‐ The first maintains that it was inspired by the book Tengo Ganas De Ti by Federico Moccia, in which the protagonists make the gesture on the Ponte Milvio in Rome. ‐ The second theory says that it was inspired by a Chinese custom, which consists of closing a padlock on a post or fence in the Huang Mountains and then throwing away the key. Les Invalides The imposing architectural complex formed by the Hôtel National des Invalides (National Palace of the Invalides ) was built in the 17th century as a residence for retired French soldiers. The first guests of the Invalides began to arrive in 1674 , and there were more than 4,000 by the end of the century. Soldiers who had served in the French army for more than ten years were allowed to retire and, contrary to what one might think, they did not spend their time telling anecdotes about the war and playing cards, but rather they used it to learn about culture and do some work repairing uniforms or shoes, among other tasks. The Palais National des Invalides is one of the most important monuments in Paris, not only because of its great artistic wealth and its imposing appearance crowned by a beautiful golden dome, but also because it is an important part of the French army's past and is the tomb of Napoleon. Church of Saint Louis des Invalides The church of Les Invalides was conceived to serve the king and the soldiers. Although everyone attended mass at the same time, they had to enter the temple through different places. ‐ The Dome Church: Built between 1677 and 1706, the royal chapel was later converted into a military pantheon which houses the sarcophagus containing the ashes of Napoleon I. From the outside, the 100-metre-high golden dome is striking from different parts of the city. ‐ The Soldiers' Church: This part of the church is decorated with a hundred trophies taken from the enemy , representing the history of the French army from 1805 to the 20th century. Centre National d'Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou The Georges Pompidou National Centre for Art and Culture is one of the most important art and research centres in the world. It houses the National Museum of Modern Art, a library and a centre for musical experimentation. It also has a hall with a capacity for 2,000 people. At the Pompidou Centre, as it is commonly called, you can find a catalogue of more than 76 thousand works of art, including works by Modigliani, Matisse, Joan Miró and Picasso. The building was one of the first to be built in the high - tech style, making its architecture an attraction in itself. This cultural centre is one of the most visited places in Paris, and like many of the museums in this city, admission is free on the first Sunday of the month. Latin Quarter of Paris The Latin Quarter of Paris (Quartier Latin) is located south of the Île de la Cité and is one of the busiest and liveliest areas of the city. It owes its name to the Medieval Period, when the inhabitants of the area were students who used Latin to communicate. Since the Middle Ages, the students of the Latin Quarter had a great influence on France, and during the 19th and 20th centuries they carried out student movements of great political significance. The Latin Quarter was one of the hot spots during the May Revolution of 1968. A walk through the Latin Quarter After crossing the Place Saint Michel, where there is a huge fountain with the figure of Saint Michael fighting a dragon, you enter the network of small and charming streets that make up the Latin Quarter. From this point onwards, there are only restaurants and cafes offering pleasant terraces at very affordable prices. Although there are several streets with very nice restaurants, one of the main arteries of the district is the Rue Huchette. Gastronomy Paris is one of the gourmet capitals of the world. Here you will find different preparations of various products such as fish, salads, seafood and meat, accompanied by the best sauces, as well as world-class wines, produced in France. Typical dishes ‐ Foie gras: Liver of fattened ducks or geese. ‐ Boeuf Bourguignon: Beef stewed in red wine. - Escargots: Snails. - Croque - monsieur: Baked ham and cheese sandwich. - Quiche Lorraine: Savory tart made with eggs and cream, as well as other ingredients such as meats and cheese. - Fromage: Cheese. - Coq au vin: Chicken with vegetables cooked in wine. - Pot - au - feu: Beef stew with vegetables. - Brioche: Sweet pastry made with eggs, yeast, milk, butter and sugar. - Tarte Tatin: Apple tart in which the apples are caramelized . - Crepe: Wheat flour cake that can have both sweet and savory ingredients. - Ratatouille: Ratatouille made with eggplant, tomato, zucchini , peppers and basil. French Cheeses France is one of the most important cheese producing countries in the world. Not in vain is it known as “ the country of a thousand cheeses ” , in France it is possible to choose a different cheese for each day of the year . Just walking down the street and especially in the markets, it is surprising the quantity and quality of cheeses in France. More than 400 different types of cheese are produced in the country. Pastries and cakes of France One of the greatest delights of French cuisine is its breads, sweets and cakes. Paris is full of boulangeries and patisseries (bakeries and patisseries) where you can enjoy the creations of the artisan pastry chefs fresh from the oven. As a recommendation, every traveler should try both the brioches and the pain au chocolat, a sweet similar to the napolitanas but with a different texture. As a curiosity, the famous croissants are not originally from France, but from Austria. Opening hours The French usually eat lunch and dinner earlier than we are used to in Argentina. Most restaurants open from 12:00 to 15:00 and from 19:30 to 23:00. In any case, Paris is a city that is very adapted to tourism and there is usually no problem finding somewhere to eat at any time of day. Prices Although it is true that Paris is not a cheap city, it is possible to taste the most special and avant-garde dishes in the most chic restaurants in the capital, or to have a two-course menu and dessert for only €10. Recommended areas to eat It is possible to find restaurants and takeaway food outlets in every corner of the city, but if you are looking to spend a pleasant time enjoying French cuisine, the most recommended areas are the Latin Quarter and Montmartre. Shopping Paris is one of the epicenters of world fashion and as such, there is a wide variety of shops, stores and galleries that exhibit the latest in European design. Department stores ‐ Galeries Lafayette (Boulevard Haussmann 40): Declared a historical monument thanks to its spectacular neo-Byzantine dome , the Galeries Lafayette in Paris is one of the most visited department stores in the world. It is worth visiting even if you do not want to buy anything. ‐ Printemps (Boulevard Haussmann 64): Located next to the previous one, the Printemps department store offers the most luxurious fashion brands in the world. It is difficult to find items for less than €300. ‐ Bazaar of the Hotel de Ville, BVH: (Rue du Temple 14): Despite being famous and central , we could define the BVH as a "Corte Ingl é s". It does not offer the luxury of the previous ones. Luxury shopping streets ‐ Champs- Élysées : Paris ’s most famous boulevard is also one of its most important shopping streets . This is where the Louis Vuitton flagship store is located, which is visited by hundreds of customers and thousands of curious people every day, so there is likely to be a queue to get in. The vast majority of customers are wealthy Asians. ‐ Avenue Montaigne: This small street is home to the most luxurious and expensive shops in Paris . It is worth visiting if only to see the strange designs that fill its windows. ‐ Rue Royale: This street connects the Place de la Concorde with the Madeleine. Halfway along the street, the Rue Saint - Honoré runs perpendicularly through it. In Saint - Honoré you will find shops such as Hermès , Prada and Yves Saint Laurent. Continuing east on Saint - Honoré you will reach Place Vendome. But if you are looking for more affordable shopping streets , a walk around the Latin Quarter may be a good idea. Boulevard Saint - Germain, Boulevard Saint - Michelle and their surrounding streets are a good starting point. Markets - Île de la Cité Market : Located on Place Louis Lépine and open all year round, this market is one of the most famous in Paris. During the week it sells flowers and on Sundays it is complemented by birds. - Flea market: The "Marché aux Puces de Saint Ouen" is a large market where it is possible to find everything from clothes to antiques . The most important days are Saturdays and Sundays. The best way to get there is by metro, stop Porte de Clignancourt. Gift shops The best shops for buying souvenirs at a good price are in Montmartre, both in the upper part next to the Place du Tertre and in the lower part on the Rue de Steinkerque, a street that leads from the Anvers metro to the funicular. Paintings and other decorative objects As with gifts, Montmartre is the best place to buy local art. In the Place du Tertre you will find artists exhibiting their works, while in the nearby streets you will see shops and art galleries. If you want posters or old prints, on the banks of the Seine next to the Latin Quarter you will find dozens of stalls selling these items. Gastronomic products Although during the trip you can take advantage of the opportunity to try the exquisite Parisian breads and sweets, if you want to buy something to take home, the options are limited to wines, cheeses and foie gras. You won't have any trouble finding supermarkets or gourmet shops, especially in the Galeries Lafayette itself. Nightlife As in all big cities, the trendy areas and venues change quickly. The trendy spots have moved to the bustling Bastille area which, although long since abandoned by many of its neighbours, still has plenty of small, colourful bars, well-known clubs and unique nightclubs. Those looking to mingle with the stylish crowd and experience an authentic Parisian night should head east to Ménilmontant, which has a sophisticated and eclectic nightlife scene that is only getting better. It all started at Café Charbon on rue de Oberkampf, a street that is now lined with bars. Back in the heart of the city, the Marais has made an impressive comeback years ago and now offers plenty of bars, chic cafés and, surprisingly, an active gay and lesbian scene. Pigalle is the seedy sex centre of Paris, but it is home to some fine concert halls and the Moulin Rouge cabaret at 82 boulevard Cliché, where the cancan is still danced. Moulin Rouge The Moulin Rouge (Red Windmill) is the most famous Parisian cabaret in the world. It was built in 1889 by the Spaniard Josep Oller and is located on the Boulevard de Clichy, the red-light district of Pigalle, at the foot of Montmartre. The Moulin Rouge perfectly embodied the French Belle Epoque, that period between the wars which favoured artistic creation and during which the rich and poor mixed in search of fun. Artists of the stature of Charles Aznavour, Bing Crosby, Liza Minelli, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lewis and the sparrow of Paris, Édith Piaf, performed on the stage of this legendary cabaret. For those who want to relive the Belle Époque, the place still offers shows for tourists that consist of a dinner show with the classic Can - Can dance, comedy and acrobatics. Getting around Paris is a city with a wide variety of public transportation . The metro covers a large part of the city, but there is also a taxi service, buses and the RER, which is used to connect Paris with the most distant communes . It is recommended to travel on foot in this city, since this way, you will be able to appreciate in more detail all the corners and buildings that the city has. Another widely used means of transportation available to everyone is the bicycle. These are rented via parking meter on many Parisian corners and can be returned at another station.
